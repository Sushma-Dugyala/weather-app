## Weather App 
A simple and responsive Weather Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application fetches real-time weather data from an API and displays it to the user in an interactive and visually appealing way.

## why I developed this
I developed this project to improve my skills in web development and to learn how to work with real-world APIs, handle dynamic content, and create user-friendly interfaces. This project allowed me to explore using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together to build an interactive application.

## Features 
Fetch real-time weather data for any city.
Display current temperature, weather conditions, and location details.
User-friendly interface with responsive design.
Support for different weather conditions like sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.

## Technologies Used 
HTML5: Structure of the application.
CSS3: Styling and layout of the application.
JavaScript : Logic and interaction.
Weather API: Fetching real-time weather data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).

## API Integration
This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. You need to create a free account and get your API key. Replace the placeholder API_KEY in the JavaScript file with your actual API key.

## Use of Images
Background Images:
I used some images from online resources to make the project look better. These images are used as backgrounds to create a nice design.

Search Images:
I also added example images for the search feature to make it more clear and user-friendly.
